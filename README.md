# ContextFreeReader
Read your ebooks or text files anywhere, anytime


## Background
I read books everyday on my phone. Before I changed my phone to Google Pixel, I had a Samsung S6, which allowed me to open almost any non-force-fullscreen-apps in a new floating screen. I loved this feature because I play lots of [idle games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game). Often times, I had my game running, and I had my reader app running on top of the game, both being in **foreground**.

Now that I have Pixel, I don't have this feature. I decided to make one for a text reader that can run virtually on anywhere, anytime.

## Example?
Take a look at Facebook's [Messenger app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca&hl=en) on Android.

## Limitation
It only works on Android phones, because iOS doesn't support this kind of feature (floating views on service level).
